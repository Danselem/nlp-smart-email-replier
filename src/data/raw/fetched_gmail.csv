YALI Network <yalin.mailer@state.gov>,Celebrating YOU- the YALI 10 Generation!,2020-08-07,"Join me for a special #YALI10 Facebook Live No images? Click here <URL> Dear Okwudili, It's hard to believe it, but this week marked the 10th anniversary of YALI. Wow! YALI's inaugural program in 2010 brought 115 young leaders to Washington, D.C. to participate in a forum hosted by President Obama. Today, YALI has over 21,000 alumni and membership in the online YALI Network is over 650,000 strong. As the Special Coordinator for YALI at the U.S. Department of State, I am blessed with the opportunity to be serving a second Foreign Service tour supporting this amazing program. During my first assignment in 2011, I supported a forum for Young African Women Leaders who transformed their communities and their countries through their inspiring work. A lot has changed since the beginning of YALI, but the caliber of YALI members has remained constant. YOU, the young leaders who embody YALI's spirit of service leadership, make YALI more than just another program. For example, the YALI Network issued over 10,000 online course certificates during the recent YALIServes [<URL>] campaign, as members increased their knowledge on how to grow as individuals, community members, and business leaders to positively serve their communities. Many of you then used these skills to hold a virtual community service event in honor of Nelson Mandela Day. ""The YALIServes campaign,"" said one Network member, ""has developed me into a leader who is prepared to fight all social issues in my community. It has also prepared me to be an entrepreneur and a leading example. It has improved both my confidence and commitment to my community."" Who is the YALI generation? It is 2011 alumna Robyn Kriel, a fearless reporter from Zimbabwe who has written about corruption and human rights abuses in her country. She was beaten by police and her mother was imprisoned, but Robyn continued reporting because the people of Zimbabwe ""want their stories to be told."" The YALI generation is Network member Sam Sheka Moi from Sierra Leone, who regularly leads service projects to make a positive impact in his community. Sam has completed 21 YALI Network Online Courses and in turn has organized several YALILearns [<URL>] events to spread his knowledge using materials from campaigns like Africa4Her [<URL>], YALIGoesGreen [<URL>], and YALIEntrepreneurs [<URL>]. It is Dr. Laud Anthony Basing, a 2016 alumnus from Ghana who recently led a team of scientists to develop a Rapid Diagnostic Test for COVID-19. Dr. Basing credits his Fellowship experience and expanded professional network as key components in reaching the full potential of his business and work. And of course, YOU! Every member of the YALI Network is making small changes that lead to big impacts across the continent. Yours is the generation that is rising up to meet today's challenges, including COVID-19, the locust plague in East Africa, and a global reckoning on social justice. Please join me on Saturday, August 8 at 4pm GMT for a Facebook Live iReport on YALI TV commemorating #YALI10! Watch YALI TV [<URL>] Happy 10th Anniversary, YALI!

YALI Network <yalin.mailer@state.gov>,Message from Ambassador Nagy on George Floyd's Death,2020-06-16,"No images? Click here <URL> Hello YALI Network members, Like many of you, the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor and recent events have shocked and saddened me. Across the continent in countries like Nigeria, Kenya, and South Africa, Africans have rallied to express their dismay at the brutal death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and are calling for justice. I salute their peaceful expression of solidarity in support of the ideals of equal justice. George Floyd's death reminds us that we must work harder to secure the blessings of liberty for all Americans, while we also defend the rights of people throughout Sub-Saharan Africa to live in freedom and equality. Our democracy is a work in progress, it is not perfect. We are witnessing progress in action as thousands of Americans throughout the country confront racism and injustice openly and demand change with civil society pushing our government toward positive change. I am confident that justice will prevail and that the United States will be a better nation for it on the other side. The United States invests in Sub-Saharan Africa because we believe in its people and their right to live in peace and good health, in a democracy where there is justice and economic opportunities. As we strive to perfect our American democracy and live up to our ideals, we will continue to seek the same commitment of our friends and partners around the world. It is up to each of us to do our part. The Young African Leaders Initiative was founded on the belief in the potential of Africa's youth to be a force for change across the continent. This starts with embracing the values of and modeling servant leadership. If you haven't already, I encourage you to take the YALI Network Online Course on Servant Leadership [<URL>], and to participate in YALIServes [<URL>] to demonstrate how you are making an impact in your community to address the issues you see most pressing. Each of us can make a difference for the good of others. We look forward to seeing how you are making your communities a better place.

YALI Network <yalin.mailer@state.gov>,Message from Ambassador Nagy on COVID-19,2020-03-31,"Follow the safety guidelines outlined by the CDC No images? Click here <URL> Hello YALI Network members, I hope this message finds you and your families, friends, and communities safe and in good health. At this unprecedented time, I want you to know that the U.S. government is working around the clock to help stop the spread of COVID-19. The United States is deploying the full range of U.S. resources to contain COVID-19, not just at home, but also across the globe. Over the last 20 years, the United States has invested more than $100 billion to improve health care systems throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. These investments have saved lives and trained African health care providers to be better prepared for health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. The United States continues to partner with the Africa Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and national public health institutions in Africa to support preparedness, and response to the ongoing global public health emergency that spread out of China and is now engulfing the world. These partnerships are important, but every member of the YALI Network also has a critical role to play in stopping the spread of COVID-19. I urge you to follow the safety guidelines outlined by the CDC [<URL>], and to encourage members of your community to do the same. These include: Avoid large groups and practice social distancing. Wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds. Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue away. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth. Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces. Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care. We are all in this fight together. Please let me know in the comments on Facebook what you're doing to keep your communities healthy [<URL>]. Please also follow me on Twitter at @AsstSecStateAF [<URL>] for the latest updates on how the United States is partnering with Africans to combat COVID-19.

Click here <URL> Hello YALI Network members! Greetings from the Bureau of African Affairs at the U.S. Department of State. I recently returned from a whirlwind trip to six African countries - Central African Republic (CAR), Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, and Sudan and would like to share some highlights. While I enjoy traveling across Africa and meeting with government officials, business leaders, and civil society, my favorite part is always engaging with dynamic youth like you. From discussing upcoming elections with officials in CAR, to deepening U.S.-Africa university partnerships in Ethiopia, and affirming the United States' commitment to Sudan during this monumental time in its democracy, I addressed the United States' key priorities in Africa. These include advancing peace and security across the continent, urging governments to create a welcoming environment for increased trade and investment, creating educational and job opportunities for African youth, and responding to humanitarian crises. In each country I visited, I was deeply inspired by the youth I met. For example, the Young African Leaders Initiative (YALI) alumni I met in Bangui and Juba are doing important work to promote reconciliation, create entrepreneurs, empower girls and women, and serve internally displaced populations. Across the continent, YALI alumni and Network members are doing important work promoting peace and social cohesion, training young entrepreneurs, and preserving the environment. I look forward to commemorating the 10th anniversary of the YALI with you in 2020. It's hard to believe that the YALI Network is now over 650,000 members strong! Go YALI! Check out my blog [<URL>] about my trip and also follow me on Twitter at @AsstSecStateAF [<URL>] to keep up with our activities - we welcome your engagement and suggestions. The United States stands with you and is committed at the highest levels. In fact, last week another Department official, Under Secretary for Political Affairs David Hale, traveled to Cote d'Ivoire and Niger to strengthen commercial ties and advance peace and security through regional partnerships, and Secretary Pompeo is traveling to Senegal, Angola, and Ethiopia. The United States looks forward to continuing our journey together to promote shared American and African prosperity and security.
